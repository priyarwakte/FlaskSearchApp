waiting dinner pococurante ordered concert
candide found music delicious

noise said senator may amuse one half hour
last longer would grow tiresome everybody though
durst music day art executing difficult
things difficult cannot please long perhaps
fonder opera found secret making

messiah take great pair compasses armoury heaven
circumscribe work esteem writer
spoiled tasso hell devil transforms lucifer sometimes
toad times pigmy makes repeat

devils cannonading heaven neither man italy could
take pleasure melancholy extravagances marriage sin
death snakes brought forth sin enough turn
